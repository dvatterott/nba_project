Playing with NBA data

nba_career_stats_2016_Feb_14.pkl -- This the data used [here](http://www.danvatterott.com/blog/2016/02/21/grouping-nba-players/) and elsewhere on my blog.
This pkl is a pandas dataframe. It was collected via the NBA.com api and basketball reference.

The script bball_data_collect.py has some functions that I wrote for collecting nba data.

oldplayersIncluded_nba_career_stats_2016_Feb_14.pkl -- This identical to the above pkl except it includes players before 1979 (before the 3-pt line).
